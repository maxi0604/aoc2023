# AOC 2023
## The plan
With descending priority:
- Solve the challenges
- Have solutions run in reasonable time
- Use a different language for each day
- If the above fails, use a different presentation for the language from before (e. g. local HTML site vs. console output)
- If applicable, get the code running in an environment similar to a real device/deployment environment (e. g. QEMU)
- Document the process used to get the code running if it's interesting.
- Come up with nice algorithms
- Come up with optimal (with respect to space/time complexity) algorithms
