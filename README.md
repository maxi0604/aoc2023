# AOC 2023
## The plan
With descending priority:
- Solve the challenges
- Have solutions run in reasonable time
- Use a different language for each day
- If the above fails, use a different presentation for the language from before (e. g. local HTML site vs. console output)
- If applicable, get the code running in an environment similar to a real device/deployment environment (e. g. QEMU, after the code is done in ol' reliable [RARS](https://github.com/TheThirdOne/rars))
- Document the process used to get the code running if it's interesting.
- Come up with nice algorithms
- Come up with optimal (with respect to space/time complexity) algorithms

Ideas for languages, in no particular order:
- [x] C
- [x] C#
- [x] C++
- [x] Haskell
- [x] JavaScript + HTML + CSS
- [x] OCaml
- [x] Rust
- [x] x86-64 Assembly
- [ ] ARM Assembly
- [ ] Ada
- [ ] COBOL
- [ ] Clojure
- [ ] Common Lisp
- [ ] D
- [ ] Elixir
- [ ] Erlang
- [ ] F#
- [ ] Go
- [ ] Java
- [ ] Julia
- [ ] Kotlin
- [ ] Lua
- [ ] PHP
- [ ] Pascal
- [ ] Python
- [ ] R
- [ ] RISC-V Assembly
- [ ] Scala
- [ ] TypeScript
- [ ] Uiua
- [ ] VHDL
- [ ] Zig
- [ ] Zsh

Note that there are more languages than days here. This is deliberate.

## Log
- d1: Finished part 1 with **üñ•Ô∏è x86-64 Assembly**, part 2 was becoming too depressing, so I wrote **üá® C** instead. (Wow, wouldn't have expected to ever consider C as an upgrade...)
- d2: Finished part 1 and 2 with **Œª Haskell**. After wasting way too much time on unsuccessfully trying to understand parser combinators, I just wrote a minor abomination using `splitOn`. The actual tasks were quite fun to implement (It's always fun to get to use `transpose`), however.
- d3: Wrote both parts in **ü¶Ä Rust**. For part 1, I spent way too much time trying to debug some off-by-one error at the end of a line. Fixed it by just padding each line with dots internally. Part 2 went over easily. Using multiple binaries in the same crate made it really pleasant to split the code for both parts. The fact that rust considers a `String` to be valid UTF-8 could be worked around easily by just storing the input as bytes and converting to `&str` where needed. Hit the rate limit, after which it also doesn't ever tell you whether your attempts are too high or too low again (probably to prevent binary searching for the answer).
- d4: Wrote both parts in **üê´ OCaml**. This took longer than it would if I hadn't also stubbornly decided that today is the day on which I finally grok parser combinators (See above). Wrote a parser combinator and fought with a weird "Why is that of that type" bug and finished part one on the first submission. For part 2, I don't really see the functional solution, so I wrote a `for` loop that mutates an `int array`. I still don't know the difference between `in`, `;` and `;;` precisely but it works. Also finished part 2 on first submission. I definitely want to combine more parsers in the future, maybe I'll try `Parsec` again now. I didn't bother with making it build both binaries today, so you'll have to manually change `d4/dune` to do that.
- d5: Wrote both parts in **#Ô∏è‚É£ C#**. No complaints about the language, considering that it's a spiced up Java and my childhood programming language. Part 1 went over easily. Part 2 took forever because of my aversion to rewriting completely exactly when it would be the right time to do so, as well as imperative programming badness. All in all, got done though.
- d6: Wrote both parts in **‚ûï C++** while not at home. Bruteforce was way fast enough. Had integer overflow on part 2.
- d7: Had I known about the theme of this day beforehand, I would've reserved OCaml for it. Instead, I decided it would be fun to build a nice little page for it with **üåê JavaScript, HTML and CSS**. While that probably took more time than actually writing the code, it was a fun experience. Also, I didn't think I'd be the one who falls for the "JavaScript `array.sort` meme" but here we are. I'd recommend to keep that in mind before you write JS. CSS and HTML were quite fun to write though and did show that some technical parts of the Internet are actually quite well-made.
